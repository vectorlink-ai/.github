**VectorLink.ai** is an AI consultancy focused on utilising AI and ML for modelling, scalable solutions which make use of embedding vectors, and keeping everything tied closely with structured data. We like to focus on the use of Open Source Software solutions to ensure flexibility and cost savings for our clients.

Our team has extensive expertise in: 

* Creating vector embeddings from structured data for a range of problems
  * Semantic Search
  * Auto Categorisation
  * Entity Resolution
  * Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
* Vector Indexing Strategies which scale to billions of vectors
* Large Graph Databases (i.e. identity graphs)
* Succinct Datastructures for indexing data in the large for specific use-cases
* GPU Acceleration techniques (Using e.g. Cuda)

Our suite of open source vector manipulation tools can be found in our [VectorLink repository](https://github.com/vectorlink-ai/vectorlink/).
